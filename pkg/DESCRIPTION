Description: The main part of this package is the simulation of a survival study
    based on simulated gene expression level data and simulated patient data.
    Functions to generate such gene expression level data and patient data are
    included as well.  Resulting error rate (FDR) and power rate can be
    visualized.  Thus, this package can be used for sample size or power
    estimations in the planning of a study.
